----Basic Git commands----

To use Git, developers use specific commands to copy, create, change, and combine code. 
These commands can be executed directly from the command line or by using an application like GitHub Desktop. 
--Here are some common commands for using Git:

git init: initializes a brand new Git repository and begins tracking an existing directory. 
          It adds a hidden subfolder within the existing directory that houses the internal data structure required for version control.

git clone: creates a local copy of a project that already exists remotely. 
           The clone includes all the project's files, history, and branches.

git add: stages a change. Git tracks changes to a developer's codebase, but it's necessary to stage and take a snapshot of the changes to include them in the project's history. 
This command performs staging, the first part of that two-step process. Any changes that are staged will become a part of the next snapshot and a part of the project's history. 
Staging and committing separately gives developers complete control over the history of their project without changing how they code and work.
